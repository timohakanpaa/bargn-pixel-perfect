    faqHeading: "Got Questions? We Got Answers",
    "faq.subheading": "(And they're probably sassier than you expected)",
    "faq.q1": "How does this 50% off magic actually work?",
    "faq.a1": "Simple AF. Our AI learns what you're into (legally stalking your preferences), matches you with partner spots, and boom - 50% off everything. No tricks, no fine print that requires a law degree to understand.",
    "faq.q2": "Is this actually legit or some sketchy pyramid scheme?",
    "faq.a2": "Bruh, we're as legit as they come. Zero commission model means partners save money, you save money, everyone's happy. We're basically the Robin Hood of discounts, but with better tech and less archery.",
    "faq.q3": "What if I'm too broke for the membership fee?",
    "faq.a3": "€8.8/month is literally less than two overpriced coffees. Plus, you'll save that back on your first deal. If you're still hesitant, the yearly plan is €53 - that's like €4.42/month. Your future self will thank you.",
    "faq.q4": "Can I cancel anytime or are you gonna hold my money hostage?",
    "faq.a4": "Cancel anytime, no drama, no guilt trips, no 47-step cancellation process. We're confident you'll love it, but we're not gonna trap you like some gym membership from hell.",
    "faq.q5": "How many partners do you actually have?",
    "faq.a5": "500+ and growing daily. Restaurants, cafes, gyms, spas, entertainment venues - basically everywhere you'd want to spend money. We're expanding faster than your ex's dating history.",
    "faq.q6": "What's this AI thing everyone keeps talking about?",
    "faq.a6": "Our AI is basically your personal deal hunter that never sleeps. It learns your taste, tracks your location (with permission, we're not creeps), and serves up deals you'll actually use. No more random pizza discounts when you're lactose intolerant.",
    "faq.q7": "Do I have to show some embarrassing coupon at checkout?",
    "faq.a7": "Hell no. Just show the sleek Bargn app on your phone. It's actually cool-looking, not some janky coupon that screams 'I'm cheap.' You'll look like the smart one while others pay full price like it's 2019.",
    "faq.q8": "What if a partner doesn't honor the discount?",
    "faq.a8": "That's what we call a 'partner violation' and we take that personally. Contact us and we'll sort it faster than you can say 'refund.' Plus, we'll make sure it doesn't happen again.",
    faqQ1: "Can I bail if I want?",
    faqA1: "Duh! Cancel whenever you want, no guilt trips or weird exit surveys. We're not your clingy ex.",
    faqQ2: "How does this magic work?",
    faqA2: "Flash that Bargn membership like the VIP you are. Boom - 50% off instantly. No coupons, no hassle, no cap.",
    faqQ3: "Am I trapped in a contract?",
    faqA3: "Hell no! We're not a gym membership. Month-to-month or yearly - your choice. Cancel whenever, we'll still be friends.",
